# Horiseon Social Media Services

## Description 

The goal was to refactor existing code and implement HTML and CSS semantic elements in the code to make it more readable. Other tasks included adding comments and make the webpage more accessible by adding the needed elements so the webpage would comply with accessibility standards and guidelines.


## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
